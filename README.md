## 🧠 **Project Description (for GitHub repo “About” section)**

> **Voice Controlled Object Detection** is an AI project that allows users to control and trigger real-time object detection using voice commands.
> It combines **speech recognition** with **computer vision (YOLOv8)** to create a hands-free, interactive system for identifying objects through a webcam or video feed.

# 🎤 Voice Controlled Object Detection

## 🧩 Overview
**Voice Controlled Object Detection** is an AI-powered application that enables users to control an object detection system using **voice commands**.  
It merges **speech recognition** and **YOLOv8 deep learning** to detect and label objects in real time — all hands-free.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🎙️ Voice-activated commands for starting/stopping detection  
- 🧠 Real-time object detection using YOLOv8  
- 📷 Works with webcam or video file input  
- 🔊 Speech feedback for identified objects (optional)  
- ⚡ Easy-to-run Python script with minimal setup  

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- **Python 3.8+**
- **OpenCV**
- **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)**
- **SpeechRecognition**
- **PyAudio**
- **NumPy**

## 🧰 Installation & Setup

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thanushree2604/VoiceCoder_Project.git
   cd VoiceCoder_Project
````

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Use voice commands**

   * Say **"start detection"** to begin.
   * Say **"stop detection"** to stop.
   * Say **"exit"** to close the program.

---

## 📸 Example Workflow

1. The app listens for your voice.
2. Once you say "start detection," it activates YOLOv8.
3. The camera stream opens and detects objects in real time.
4. You can stop or exit anytime using your voice.
